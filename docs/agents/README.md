# Agent Briefs

Each file in this folder is a "one-shot" brief you can hand to a separate agent (or human) to execute in parallel.

Rules:

- Do not change `docs/SPEC.md` semantics unless explicitly requested; prefer adding clarifying docs or appendices.
- Adhere to `docs/INTERFACES.md`. If you must change an interface, propose the minimal diff and justify it.
- Every deliverable must include an acceptance test or benchmark plan, even if the code is stubbed initially.
